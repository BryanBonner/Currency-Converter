This app uses the top 20 most traded currencies and demonstrates:
- Swipe gestures
- UI Picker Views (add to favorite currency)
- UI Table Views (add to home, add to foreign favorites, and swipe to delete)
- Singleton data model
- NSCoder/NSArchiver for storing user's favorite currency (not quite working)
- Dictionaries and YQL calls (not quite working)

The user may add currencies to their favorites from a picker and then select home or foreign from a table view and convert them.
